Note, that glibc does _not_ expose the rusage argument, i.e. most of
userspace is unaware that waitid() does allow you to get rusage
information. So users first need to know that waitid() has an rusage
argument and then need to call the waitid() syscall directly.

Speaking specifically for Linux now, I think that rusage does not
actually expose the information most relevant users are interested in.
On Linux nowadays it is _way_ more interesting to retrieve stats
relative to the cgroup the task lived in etc.
Doing a git grep -i rusage in the systemd source code shows that rusage
is used _nowhere_. And I consider an init system to be the most likely
candidate to be interested in rusage.
