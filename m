Good day3
My name is Miss. Sirah Abdelqader. I am 22years old, I=E2=80=99m the only
child of the former Central Bank Governor of Sudan, Hazem Abdelqader,
whom am sure was poisoned to death by his colleagues on their visit to
Turkey in 2018 but the government of Omar al-Bashir gave a report that
my father died of a heart attack, they killed him in order to appoint
a new governor but I left everything to GOD to judge.

My mother died 2 months ago of cancer. Because of the ongoing crisis
here in Sudan, I decided to relocate to another city since my mother
is dead and in the cause of moving our properties I discovered a bank
document in my late father=E2=80=99s briefcase indicating that my late fath=
er
deposited huge sum of $14,000,000. with a bank in Abidjan Ivory Coast
which my name was on the next of kin according to the document which I
have in my hand now as I will be heading to Abidjan Ivory Coast.

Please send your urgent reply to me as I am going to Ivory Coast for
this inheritance claim but only want you to stand by me and provide
your account details to transfer the fund because with the ongoing
crisis it=E2=80=99s not advisable to transfer the fund to Sudan and the wor=
st
is that those who killed my late father are huanting for my life to
kill me now.

I am living as an orphan now and my life is in a big danger because
the political enemies of my father is after my life and that is the
more reasons I have to contact you so that you can help me claim the
money and move to your country with the money for a better life and to
continue with my education right there under your care as my guardian.

Thanks.

Miss. Sirah Abdelqader
