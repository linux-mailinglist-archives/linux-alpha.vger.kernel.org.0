No, but if you have one reader that is hogging the rwsem, and then a
writer is queued up on the rwsem afterwards, I think new readers will
sometimes be queued up behind the writer. So even though the rwsem is
only actually held by a reader, new readers can't immediately take the
rwsem because the rwsem code thinks that would be unfair to a pending
writer who just wants to make some quick change. I'm not super
familiar with this code, but basically I think it works roughly like
this:

If the rwsem code notices that a bunch of readers are preventing a
writer from taking the lock, the rwsem code will start queuing new
readers behind the queued writer. You can see in rwsem_read_trylock()
that the trylock fastpath is skipped if anyone is waiting on the rwsem
or the handoff flag is set, and in rwsem_down_read_slowpath() the
"reader optimistic lock stealing" path is skipped if the lock is
currently held by multiple readers or if the handoff bit is set.

The handoff bit can be set in rwsem_try_write_lock() by a writer "if
it is an RT task or wait in the wait queue for too long". Basically I
think it means something like "I think other users of the lock are
hogging it more than they should, stop stealing the lock from me".
And the RWSEM_WAIT_TIMEOUT for triggering handoff mode is pretty
short, RWSEM_WAIT_TIMEOUT is defined to something like 4ms, so I think
that's how long writers tolerate the lock being hogged by readers
before they prevent new readers from stealing the lock.
