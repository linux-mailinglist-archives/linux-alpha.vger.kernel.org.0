Naah. I think the Jensen actually had an ISA slot. Came with a
whopping 8MB too, so the ISA DMA should work just fine.

Or maybe it was EISA only? I really don't remember.

It's possible that alpha should get rid of the ISA config option, and
use ISA_BUS instead. That would be the proper config if there aren't
actually any ISA _slots_, and it would disable the 3c515 driver.

But it turns out that the compile error is easy to fix. Just make it
use isa_virt_to_bus(), which that driver does elsewhere anyway.

I have no way - or interest - to test that on real hardware, but I did
check that if I relax the config I can at least build it cleanly on
x86-64 with that change.

It can't make matters worse, and it's the RightThing(tm).

Since Micheal replied about that other alpha issue, maybe he knows
about the ISA slot situation too?

But anyway, 3c515 should compile cleanly again.

I picked it up manually now along with the arm vexpress cpufreq one.

I think these should be fixed as of the pull request this morning.

Ok, that hasn't hit my tree yet.

This one should be fixed as of the parisc pull this morning.

So a few more remaining (mainly the suspend/resume ones), but slowly
making progress.
