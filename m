Subject: [PATCH 09/18] Documentation/barriers: Remove references to [smp_]read_barrier_depends()

The [smp_]read_barrier_depends() barrier macros no longer exist as
part of the Linux memory model, so remove all references to them from
the Documentation/ directory.

Although this is fairly mechanical on the whole, we drop the "CACHE
COHERENCY" section entirely from 'memory-barriers.txt' as it doesn't
make any sense now that the dependency barriers have been removed.

-Imagine the system has the following properties:
-
- (*) an odd-numbered cache line may be in cache A, cache C or it may still be
-     resident in memory;
-
- (*) an even-numbered cache line may be in cache B, cache D or it may still be
-     resident in memory;
-
- (*) while the CPU core is interrogating one cache, the other cache may be
-     making use of the bus to access the rest of the system - perhaps to
-     displace a dirty cacheline or to do a speculative load;
-
- (*) each cache has a queue of operations that need to be applied to that cache
-     to maintain coherency with the rest of the system;
-
- (*) the coherency queue is not flushed by normal loads to lines already
-     present in the cache, even though the contents of the queue may
-     potentially affect those loads.
-
-Imagine, then, that two writes are made on the first CPU, with a write barrier
-between them to guarantee that they will appear to reach that CPU's caches in
-the requisite order:
-
-	CPU 1		CPU 2		COMMENT
-	===============	===============	=======================================
-					u == 0, v == 1 and p == &u, q == &u
-	v = 2;
-	smp_wmb();			Make sure change to v is visible before
-					 change to p
-	<A:modify v=2>			v is now in cache A exclusively
-	p = &v;
-	<B:modify p=&v>			p is now in cache B exclusively
-
-The write memory barrier forces the other CPUs in the system to perceive that
-the local CPU's caches have apparently been updated in the correct order.  But
-now imagine that the second CPU wants to read those values:
-
-	CPU 1		CPU 2		COMMENT
-	===============	===============	=======================================
-	...
-			q = p;
-			x = *q;
-
-The above pair of reads may then fail to happen in the expected order, as the
-cacheline holding p may get updated in one of the second CPU's caches while
-the update to the cacheline holding v is delayed in the other of the second
-CPU's caches by some other cache event:
-
-	CPU 1		CPU 2		COMMENT
-	===============	===============	=======================================
-					u == 0, v == 1 and p == &u, q == &u
-	v = 2;
-	smp_wmb();
-	<A:modify v=2>	<C:busy>
-			<C:queue v=2>
-	p = &v;		q = p;
-			<D:request p>
-	<B:modify p=&v>	<D:commit p=&v>
-			<D:read p>
-			x = *q;
-			<C:read *q>	Reads from v before v updated in cache
-			<C:unbusy>
-			<C:commit v=2>
-
-Basically, while both cachelines will be updated on CPU 2 eventually, there's
-no guarantee that, without intervention, the order of update will be the same
-as that committed on CPU 1.
-
-
-To intervene, we need to interpolate a data dependency barrier or a read
-barrier between the loads (which as of v4.15 is supplied unconditionally
-by the READ_ONCE() macro).  This will force the cache to commit its
-coherency queue before processing any further requests:
-
-	CPU 1		CPU 2		COMMENT
-	===============	===============	=======================================
-					u == 0, v == 1 and p == &u, q == &u
-	v = 2;
-	smp_wmb();

-			<C:queue v=2>
-	p = &v;		q = p;
-			<D:request p>
-	<B:modify p=&v>	<D:commit p=&v>
-			<D:read p>
-			smp_read_barrier_depends()
-			<C:unbusy>
-			<C:commit v=2>
-			x = *q;
-			<C:read *q>	Reads from v after v updated in cache
-
-
-This sort of problem can be encountered on DEC Alpha processors as they have a
-split cache that improves performance by making better use of the data bus.
-While most CPUs do imply a data dependency barrier on the read when a memory
-access depends on a read, not all do, so it may not be relied on.
-
-Other CPUs may also have split caches, but must coordinate between the various
-cachelets for normal memory accesses.  The semantics of the Alpha removes the
-need for hardware coordination in the absence of memory barriers, which
-permitted Alpha to sport higher CPU clock rates back in the day.  However,
-please note that (again, as of v4.15) smp_read_barrier_depends() should not
-be used except in Alpha arch-specific code and within the READ_ONCE() macro.
